AddTwoNumbersVer2.java
1: Some amount of time also lapsed in length calculation of input value received, this time complexity can be reduced if 
we are declaring length variable in push function which will keep on incrementing.
2: 39ms Execution time, if we exclude length calculation Time complexity for this solution will be o(max(n,m))
3: If we include length calculation Time Complexity for this solution will be o(m+n+max(n,m))
4: Runtime: 39 ms, faster than 90.97% of Java online submissions for Add Two Numbers.

AddTwoNumbersVer1.java
1: This solution is done via Brute Force and only valid for Integer range or by changing variable can scale upto 
Long range.
